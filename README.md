# .emacs.d

This is my personal emacs setup, feel free to pull and use whatever you like. I have attempted to provide thoroughly descriptive comments to allow for others to easily pull parts and modify as they please. I won't be adding any information as to the general structure for now. This README will be where I am going to keep track of what I have to do.
